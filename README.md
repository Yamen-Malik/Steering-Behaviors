Steerinng Behaviors
====================
About the project
-----------------
In this project I followed the nature of code [course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZV4yEcW3uDwOgGXKUUsPOM) / [book](https://natureofcode.com) from [the coding train](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain) channel.

**Note**: I have implemented my Vector class in an inefficient way so please don't use it in your projects.

Requirements
